# Kernel

This repository contains my second attempt at making a Kernel.

## Goals for the project
My goals for the project are to build a kernel that is:
- Fast
- Compatible with most hardware
- Customizable
- Non-Telemetric
- Easy to use (in terms of commands, and other)
- Easy to understand
- Low on RAM usage
- Good for both servers and computers
